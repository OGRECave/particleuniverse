PORTING TO A NEW RENDERER:
=========================
Development of Particle Universe was started with Ogre 3D as the rendering engine. The Particle Universe code was strongly integrated with Ogre. 
Besides the rendering code, a lot of other Ogre features were used. To make porting to another rendering engine a bit easier, the 
Particle Universe code is abstracted from the Ogre code as much as possible. To prevent that al lot of classes have to be redesigned as a 
Particle Universe version, the first step to the abstraction is to isolate the Ogre code and typedef or inherit it (where possible). This involves the 
features that do not directly apply to rendering. It applies to the following header files:

ParticleUniverseAlloc.h
ParticleUniverseAny.h
ParticleUniverseAxisAlignedBox.h
ParticleUniverseCamera.h
ParticleUniverseConfigFile.h
ParticleUniverseController.h
ParticleUniverseControllerManager.h
ParticleUniverseException.h
ParticleUniverseLogManager.h
ParticleUniverseMath.h
ParticleUniversePlane.h
ParticleUniversePlugin.h (Deriving ParticleUniversePlugin from Ogre::Plugin is not strictly needed for the port)
ParticleUniverseRadixSort.h
ParticleUniverseScriptCompiler.h
ParticleUniverseScriptDeserializer.h
ParticleUniverseSimpleSpline.h
OgreSingleton.h
ParticleUniverseSimpleSphere.h
ParticleUniverseTypes.h

TODO: ScriptTranslatorManager ???????
TODO: OgreImage.h
TODO: OgreMovableObject.h?????
TODO: OgreWorkQueue.h
TODO: OgreNode.h?????
TODO: OgreSceneManager.h????
TODO: AtlasImageTool.cpp (remove Ogre.h)
TODO: Ogre::NameValuePairList
TODO: Ogre::uchar (ParticleUniverseNoise.cpp)
TODO: ParticleUniverseDll.cpp (remove root and use another method to install/uninstall the plugin)

In addition: 
- all Renderer files must be redesigned so they fit the new renderer. There is no easy way to prevent this.
- MeshSurfaceEmitter and VertexEmitter need to be adapted to the new rendersystem.
- Externs that can be attached to a SceneNode.
- Creation of depthmap in ParticleUniverseSystemManager.
