- Changing orientation of the ScenNode results in incorrect behaviour of the Vertex Emitter (shape is distorted).
- 'Bug': Texture rotation for entities and boxes don´t behave as expected. With the current design it is difficult
  to rotate the texures independently (for boxes only) and it is not possible to set a new rotationspeed if the
  texture rotation has been activated.
- Soft particles does not work with entities: For now, this is acceptable. 
- With introduction of normal in the BoxRenderer and setting the dimensions in the emitter, causes disformation of the boxes. This option has not been
  added because it involves more than a few lines of code.
- If quota emitted techniques is set to 100, the actual number max. is only 50? Skipping one everytime in the loop?

================================================================================================================
Bugs: Release 1.4
-----------------
 :arrow: Plugin: OnRandomObserver::_processParticle() validates the random test for each particle, which should be done after one update. See http://www.fxpression.com/phpBB3/viewtopic.php?f=4&t=449 ([color=#00BF00]DONE[/color]).
 :arrow: Plugin: PathFollower: Interpolation not correct. See http://www.fxpression.com/phpBB3/viewtopic.php?f=4&t=436  ([color=#00BF00]DONE[/color]).
 :arrow: Plugin: Bug in OnQuotaObserver::_postProcessParticles(): Two times technique quota was calculated. See http://www.fxpression.com/phpBB3/viewtopic.php?f=4&t=446 ([color=#00BF00]DONE[/color]).
 :arrow: Plugin: example_024 doesn't rotate correctly. See http://www.fxpression.com/phpBB3/viewtopic.php?f=4&t=443 ([color=#00BF00]DONE[/color]).
 :arrow: Plugin: GeometryRotator: Deformation of boxes in boxrenderer, because of non-normalized rotation vector ([color=#00BF00]DONE[/color]).
 :arrow: Plugin: ScaleAffector: Check width, height, depth > 0 before the scaling is applied is not enough (and causes negative width, height, depth). A validation whether the width, height, depth becomes negative is done after the scaling is applied ([color=#00BF00]DONE[/color]).

 :arrow: Plugin: BeamRenderer bug: See http://www.fxpression.com/phpBB3/viewtopic.php?f=4&t=451 ([color=#00BF00]DONE[/color]).
 :arrow: Plugin: Set texture coordinate in emitter with value > 0 while there is only 1 row and 1 column causes a crash. No validation added to the plugin itself (performance), but because of a change in ParticleRenderer::getNumTextureCoords(), the editor at least performs the validation ([color=#00BF00]DONE[/color]).
 
================================================================================================================
Bugs: Release 1.3.1
-------------------
- (DONE) ParticleEmitter::_initParticleTextureCoords() the rangerandom function doesn't reach the end texture coords.
- (DONE) After the upgrade to pu 1.3 from 1.1, attaching particle systems to bones has a new problem. All particles emitted from the particle system just 
  stay at the origin, despite any direction and velocity settings (http://www.fxpression.com/phpBB3/viewtopic.php?f=5&t=396)
- (DONE) ForceField: Use class attributes so that settings can be changed although there is no factory yet. Problem is that changing settings 
  (i.e. worldsize) of the ForceField crashes the application, because the factory was not created yet.
- (DONE) keep_local on emitter level does not work.
- (DONE) Bug in ParticleSystemManager::destroyAllParticleSystems. See http://www.fxpression.com/phpBB3/viewtopic.php?f=5&t=421
- (DONE) Bug in InterparticleCollider: Fast rejection in _affect should use || instead of &&. 
  See http://www.fxpression.com/phpBB3/viewtopic.php?f=4&t=424
- (DONE) LineEmitter (and LineAffector): Writing the 'emitter Line' tokens to a script is incorrect. The name is added to the emitter type 
  (i.e. LineEmitter0 instead of Line Emitter0). Bug was in ParticleScriptSerializer::_appendTabbedString()
- (DONE) Incorrect Debug settings: See http://www.fxpression.com/phpBB3/viewtopic.php?f=5&t=412
- (DONE) Randomizing funtion to calculate texture coordinate set index also takes to 'end' value into account (the 'end' value was never returned,
  because of the truncation of the casting to uint16.

================================================================================================================
Bugs: Release 1.3
-----------------
- (DONE) Ogre::Double bug. See http://www.fxpression.com/phpBB3/posting.php?mode=reply&f=5&t=350
- (DONE) Bug in Custom Memory Allocators: http://www.fxpression.com/phpBB3/viewtopic.php?f=4&t=349
- (DONE) ParticleSystem::_notifyAttached: http://www.fxpression.com/phpBB3/viewtopic.php?f=4&t=348
- (DONE) ParticlePool::_increaseParticleTechniquePool() bug? See http://www.fxpression.com/phpBB3/viewtopic.php?f=4&t=302
- (DONE) ParticleTechnique::getNumberOfEmittedParticles(): Total number of particles in a technique not correct. 
         Must also take emitted techniques into account
- (DONE) LightRenderer: Emit light particle and set keep_local tot true in the technique doesn´t work the first time, but only after a 
         stop-start (only if force emission is true)
- (DONE) Example_021: Adding force_emitter to true causes a big explosion after the first start. After the second start it is ok 
         (loading texture probably?)

================================================================================================================
Bugs: Release 1.2
-----------------
- (DONE) ColourAffector doesn't crash anymore if it is used and the colourmap is empty. Same with PositionEmitter.
- (DONE) Soft particles don't work anymore with Ogre 1.7
- (DONE) Use of 'duration' in an emitter that is included in an alias causes a parsing exception.
- (DONE) Example_028: After a restart, there are some remaining particles emitted.
- (DONE) ParticleTechnique::initVisualDataInPool() only loops through visual particles. This must be all particles.
         (See also http://www.fxpression.com/phpBB3/viewtopic.php?f=4&t=306)
- (DONE) If a spatial hashtable is used and the interval is set, the interval calculation was performed after each particle instead
         after each (frame) update. This was incorrect (See also http://www.fxpression.com/phpBB3/viewtopic.php?f=4&t=304)
- (DONE) 'Keep_local' property fix (See also http://www.fxpression.com/phpBB3/viewtopic.php?f=4&t=184)
- (DONE) Fixed orientation of particle technique and emitter in the getDerivedPosition()
         (See also http://www.fxpression.com/phpBB3/viewtopic.php?f=4&t=309)
- (DONE) If the PhysX fluid is full, PU doesn't emit particles anymore.
- (DONE) ParticleTechnique::_processMotion() moved in the main loop and only called for non-expired particles. 
         See also  http://www.fxpression.com/phpBB3/viewtopic.php?f=4&t=305
- (DONE) Bad programming style http://www.fxpression.com/phpBB3/viewtopic.php?f=4&t=307
- (DONE) Scaling factor in SphereEmitter fixed.
- (DONE) ParticleTechnique::_processParticles() doesn't skip particles in the loop anymore:
         mPool.lockLatestParticle() function makes the pointer of the mPool jump wrong in the while loop. lockLatestParticle() is called 
         when the particle is expired, and the pointer of the mPool is changed to a next particle. After that, when the mPool.getNext() 
         function is called, it skips a particle.
- (DONE) EntityRenderer, BillboardRenderer, LightRenderer: Don't use getDerivedPosition() of the particle system inside the 
         _updateRenderQueue() loop (small performance gain).
- (DONE) CollisionAvoidanceAffector::_unprepare() and InterParticleCollider::_unprepare: Set usage of spatial hashing to 'false'.
- (DONE) ParticleSystem: LOD-level calculation was incorrect (see http://www.fxpression.com/phpBB3/viewtopic.php?f=4&t=298).
- (DONE) PositionEmitter::_calculateRequestedParticles(): Fix calculation of requested particles in case not randomized; this is to 
         prevent that more particles are requested than there are in the pool 
         (see http://www.fxpression.com/phpBB3/viewtopic.php?f=4&t=311).
- (DONE) BoxCollider, PlaneCollider and SphereCollider: Velocityscale is not taken into account (see http://www.fxpression.com/phpBB3/viewtopic.php?f=4&t=314)


================================================================================================================
Bugs: Release 1.1
-----------------
- ..\src\ParticleEmitters\ParticleUniverseMeshSurfaceEmitter.cpp(548, ParticleUniverse::MeshSurfaceEmitter::build): 24 bytes
- BillboardRenderer::copyAttributesTo(), Also copy values of mBillboardSet.
- Reattaching particle system with a billboardrenderer (same for other types) still not possible. See also
  http://www.fxpression.com/phpBB3/viewtopic.php?f=4&t=179

- (DONE) Initial velocity of a particle was not scaled.
- (DONE) If two scripts have the same name the plugin crashes. Changed this into an exception and proceed.
- (DONE) Extern ColliderTokens write the collider properties to the script in the ::write() functions.
- (DONE) mParentTechnique was not initialised to 0 for Behavious and Observer.
- (DONE) Parsing lod distances from system; the ParticleSystem::setLodDistances() always added an additional 0.0 float to the list of distances.
- (DONE) Changed check on default value in case of writing a DynamicAttribute to a script.
- (DONE) mNormal wasn't copied to the cloned CircleEmitter.
- (DONE) If DynamicAttributeCurved has no controlpoints, an exception is throwed.
- (DONE) Several miscellanious small bugfixes that where detected during development of the editor.

Bugs: Release 1.01
------------------
- (DONE) After stoping by means of fadeStop, it cannot be started again. The mStopFadeSet needs to be set to false 
  in start(). See also http://www.fxpression.com/phpBB3/viewtopic.php?f=4&t=155
- (DONE) RibbonTrailRenderer::setVisible() works on the parent node instead of the Ribbontrail itself.
  See http://www.fxpression.com/phpBB3/viewtopic.php?f=6&t=174&p=634#p634
- (DONE) TextureAnimator doesn't work properly when time_step_animation has been set.
  See http://www.fxpression.com/phpBB3/viewtopic.php?f=5&t=162&p=588#p588
- (DONE) ParticleSystemManager::destroyAllParticleSystems(): The list is cleared after destruction of the Particle Systems.
- (DONE) ParticleUniverseViewer: Recording is frames per second and not per minute.
- (DONE) Detach from parent node is not propagated to underlying components (i.e. Billboard Renderer).
  See http://www.fxpression.com/phpBB3/viewtopic.php?f=5&t=79&p=359#p359
- (DONE) InterParticleCollider: When 2 particles are colliding Particle::PEF_COLLIDED isn't set in both particles.
- (DONE) If a particle is freezed (by a DoFreeze handler) and expires, the freeze flag remains true. This means that when the particle
  is pulled out of the pool and emitted again, it doesn’t move.
- (DONE) ParticleScriptDeserializer::getGroupName() doesn't return a resource group name, but a resource name.
- (DONE) Random crashes with AABB in negative coords. See http://www.fxpression.com/phpBB3/viewtopic.php?f=5&t=170
  Was not a problem in PU.


================================================================================================================
Bugs: Release 1.0
-----------------
- (DONE) Changed 'particle->direction = ...' into 'particle->direction += ...' in Randomiser::_affect().
- (DONE) Bounding box is not calculated properly in combination with emitted emitters. See:
  http://www.fxpression.com/phpBB3/viewtopic.php?f=5&t=39
  Solution: Not reproducable with the new changes applied in the bounding box code.
- (DONE) Vortex affector cannot be applied to a Point emitter? Solution: Cannot reproduce it.
- (DONE) Changed bug in AABB code. One of the corners was always 0,0,0
- (DONE) PhysXBridge::onContactNotify sometimes results in a crash. Apparently, the userdata isn´t always a particle.
- (DONE) ParticleSystem::setEnabled(false) now works as expected.
- (DONE) PositionEmitter crashes randomly. See http://www.ogre3d.org/phpBB2/viewtopic.php?t=37426&start=100

================================================================================================================
Bugs: Release 0.8
-----------------
- (DONE) ParticleSystem. Scale description in the manual is corrupt.
- (DONE) If iteration_interval is set, the techniques are updated only once. This is inaccurate if the framerate is 
         really low.
- (DONE) An alias that includes an emitter with a duration property will crash.
- (DONE) A restarted technique doesn´t start with the proper mEnabled value.
- (DONE) Name was not copied in cloned ParticleObservers.
- (DONE) Potential infinite loop in LineAffector::_preProcessParticles, because mTimeStep is initialised with 0
- (DONE) Regular particles emitted with keep_local set to true aren´t emitted in local space.
- (DONE  (partly) If a framedrop occurs, some particles are affected heavily (a ScaleAffector causes a particle 
         to expand rapidly). This is because the time since the last update becomes relatively high.
- (DONE) Scaling of a Box in the box renderer doesn´t work.
- (DONE) Particle system with ColourAffector causes flashes, which disappear after a while. Solution: The order 
         of particle processing (which includes applying the affectors) and particle emission has been changed.
         Also the initial colour can be set.

================================================================================================================
Bugs: Release 0.7
-----------------
- (DONE) Splashes in rainSystem_1 are not visible anymore. (solution was to modify the script, because the
         splashes where expired too fast) 
- (DONE) Creating an alias technique causes an exception when the plugin shuts down.

================================================================================================================
Bugs: Release 0.6
-----------------
- (DONE) Cannot attach more than 1 Extern (affector wrapper), because it is created without any name.
- (DONE) Solved crash with MeshSurfaceEmitter

================================================================================================================
Bugs: Release 0.5
-----------------

- (DONE) FXpression particle system results in crash if restarted. This occurs with the Exploding mesh part. Problem didn't show up anymore.
- (DONE) Restart of emitted particle system doesn´t work.
- (DONE) Emission of particle systems with ribbontrail renderer doesn't show the ribbontrails.
- (DONE) Emitted technique with a ribbontrail gives exception in _notifyAttached().

================================================================================================================
Bugs: Release 0.4
-----------------

================================================================================================================
Bugs: Release 0.3
-----------------

================================================================================================================
Bugs: Release 0.2
-----------------
- (DONE) EntityRenderer misuses particle width, height and depth for scaling. Use Mesh::getBounds() to determine the
         width, height and depth of the box and relate it to the particle width, height and depth.
- (DONE) Explosion system: Sometimes the projectiles aren't visible, depending on the camera position.


================================================================================================================
Bugs: Release 0.1
-----------------
- (DONE) Errors in case of emitted technique (see explosionSystem).
         - The number of emitted techniques isn´t the same as the emission rate, but should be because of 
           force_emission = true
         - billboard_type = oriented_self doesn't present particles.
- (DONE) Parsing GravityExtern with the gravity property doesn't work properly. The GravityAffectorTokens
         should take care for the parsing, but the gravity isn't set properly.
- (DONE) test_7 testing unsuccessful. Emitted emitters in combination with duration and repeat_delay doesn't work.
         (it does work, but the time to live of the emitted emitters was incorrect)
- (DONE) Parsing EntityEmitter gives exception.
- (DONE) ParticleEmitter::_notifyStart() has an emtpy implementation. However, the duration and the force emission
         attributes need to be reset, otherwise a restart fails.
- (DONE) AlignAffector::copyAttributesTo is not called, but the ParticleAffector::copyAttributesTo is. Check whether
         this is the case with the other affectors and emitters.
- (DONE) ParticleUniverseContext: Parsing doesn't work anymore for LOD scripts. It trows exception during parsing (camera dependency?)
- (DONE) General: _notifyCurrentCamera isn't called, because the AABB isn´t determined correctly.
         SceneNode::_findVisibleObjects should call _notifyCurrentCamera, but doesn´t pass the first validation.
- (DONE) ParticleTechnique: Emitted techniques in the rainSystem script jitter. All particles must be locked after the 
         technique is expired.
- (DONE) Bug: Destroying all externs results in exception. This is because the factory is deleted earlier than the
         particle system manager.
- (DONE) ParticleTechnique: camera dependency on width, height and depth doesn't work
- (DONE) Releasemode doesn´t show anything.
- (DONE) ParticleTechnique: If the DoForceEmission is used for emitting a technique, the rain emitter is also 
                              not working properly anymore (the particles are no longer expired)
- (DONE) rainSystem: One technique of the rainSystem is continuously emitting, while the time to live has been set by the 
         emitter at 0.2. The other emitted techniques work fine.
- (DONE) Ogre.log: Error during parsing in aliasses.pua, but alias still seems to be registered.
- (DONE) ParticleTechnique: setEnabled is overridden, but not called.
- (DONE) ParticlePool destructor called for no reason
- (DONE) ParticlePool: Searching an emitter in the pool gives no results, while there are emitters created.
- (DONE) ParticleTechnique: If a particle expires in _applyParticleActions, the iterator gets screwed up.
- (DONE) ParticleUniverseBillboardRenderer: Initialisation of the renderer must be done in the technique. I.e. 
         _notifyParticleQuota ommits, which results in 0 (zero) vertices when creating a buffer.
- (DONE) MaterialToken::parse: Setting materialname doesn´t work. Somehow the argument is empty.
- (DONE) ParticleUniverseEmitterFactory: Memory Leak after closing. Probably the pool of emitters isn't cleaned-up properly.
- (DONE) General: Particles moving slowly. Implementation of particle speed needed.
- (DONE) ParticleUniverseBillboardRendererTokens: 'center_right'  isn't parsed. The other tokens (i.e. ' top_left' )
         are parsed fine (bug in Compiler2Pass where the order of registered keywords is important)
